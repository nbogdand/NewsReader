# NewsReader

This is a unique News Reader application which displays top business headlines in the US. Only most important and hot news  

For developing this app I implemented News API(https://newsapi.org/) which provides the data in JSON format. Articles are fetched from Internet
using Retrofit. 
I have also added an image to every article using Picasso, to be a more entertaining experience for users. 
For the UI, I used a custom RecycleView to be efficient with the data and the performance of the application. Furthermore, to make the 
application more responsive and cut down the time of loading the articles I used Paper to cache them.
